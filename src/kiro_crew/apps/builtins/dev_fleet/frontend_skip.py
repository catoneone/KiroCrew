"""Runtime decision: may a backend-only Pull+Build skip the frontend build?

A sync that changes nothing under ``website/`` pays the frontend build's whole
cost to reproduce a bundle already staged. This module answers whether that one
step -- ``npm run build`` plus the dist stage -- may be skipped.

It answers with a PROVENANCE RECORD, not with a comparison of artifacts. That
distinction is the whole design, and it is what the module exists to hold:

* **The property a safe skip needs is "the served bundle was produced by a
  completed frontend build from exactly the source that is on disk now".** That
  is a statement about HISTORY. No comparison of two artifacts can establish
  it, because the interesting failures leave the artifacts equal: ``npm run
  build`` is ``tsc -b && vite build`` and ``emptyOutDir`` lives inside vite, so
  a TypeScript error in freshly merged code means vite never runs and
  ``website/dist`` is left fully intact -- byte-identical to the staged copy it
  was staged from. Any artifact-to-artifact check reads that as "provenance
  holds" and skips, and the sync reports success having never built the merged
  frontend. So the record is produced by the sync itself, once, and only after
  the build step has actually SUCCEEDED: see :func:`build_record`.

* **This module cannot READ a record, only produce one and be handed one.**
  :func:`build_record` derives the pair; :func:`may_skip_frontend` takes it as
  two VALUES. There is deliberately no parameter that could carry a path,
  because a record that lives anywhere a sync step can write is a record a sync
  step can forge -- and the steps that run before the gated build execute code
  from the revision being landed (``pip install -e .`` runs its build backend,
  ``npm ci`` runs every dependency's lifecycle scripts) at the same uid as the
  process that reads it. Both fields are computable by that code, so a
  step-writable record lets it stage a bundle of its own choosing, vouch for it
  as this revision's, and have the build that would have overwritten it
  skipped. The record therefore lives in the deciding processes' own memory --
  the Dev Fleet backend's, and the runner's own script text -- and the type
  signature here is what keeps it there.

  READ THAT AS SCOPING THE RECORD, NOT THE BUNDLE. ``static/dist`` is same-uid
  writable, so a step that wants its own bundle served can simply write one and
  the gateway serves what is there, skip or no skip. What is bounded here is
  narrower: such a step cannot get that bundle VOUCHED for, so it cannot make a
  later sync skip the build that would replace it. The mechanism's durable value
  is the ACCIDENT case below -- artifacts that are equal after a failed build --
  rather than trustworthiness of what is on disk.

* **Identity, not a delta.** The record names the ``website/`` TREE OID
  (``git rev-parse HEAD:website``), which positively identifies the source the
  build read, rather than "nothing changed since some base commit". A tree OID
  cannot be vacuously satisfied the way a diff can, it needs no pre-merge base
  OID plumbed in from the caller, and because ``package-lock.json`` lives inside
  ``website/`` the same OID pins the dependency set too.

* **The build reads the WORKING TREE, and a tree OID only describes commits.**
  So both producing and honouring the record require ``website/`` to be clean
  including untracked files. Without that, an uncommitted ``website/src``
  edit -- or an untracked new component -- sits in a checkout whose committed
  tree still matches the record, and the skip serves a bundle that predates the
  edit while reporting success. Those two reads are also not independent
  checks: the checkout is MUTABLE while the verdict runs, and an edit is
  visible to one of them while uncommitted and to the other once committed, so
  their ORDER decides whether a commit landing between them is caught or missed
  by both. :func:`website_source_identity` is the single read that fixes that
  order, and :func:`may_skip_frontend` takes it twice, either side of the
  bundle walk.

* **``npm ci`` is NOT skipped.** It stays unconditional. Whether the on-disk
  ``node_modules`` is the tree ``npm ci`` would produce cannot be verified below
  the cost of running it: npm's ``node_modules/.package-lock.json`` is metadata
  it writes once and nothing reconciles with the files it describes, so it stays
  byte-identical while a package is deleted from the tree, a file inside one is
  removed, or a file is truncated. npm's ``integrity`` hashes are over the
  published TARBALL, not the extracted tree, so nothing on disk lets them be
  re-derived either. ``npm ci`` is also the step that REPAIRS such a tree, and
  it is the cheap half of the frontend work, so leaving it unconditional costs
  little and keeps the build's dependency input correct by construction.

* **Skipping is CONSERVATIVE.** Every missing, unreadable, or unobtainable
  input answers "do not skip", and the sync builds exactly as it does without
  this module. A wrong skip serves a stale SPA behind a new backend and reports
  success, which is far more expensive than the build it saves.

Four residuals are deliberately accepted rather than papered over. Two are
impurities the record tolerates because it captures provenance instead of
asserting byte-equality: ``website/vite.config.ts`` stamps ``git rev-parse
--short HEAD`` into ``dist/sw.js``, so on a backend-only sync a rebuild would
emit a different service-worker version string than the staged one (harmless --
the service worker is network-first and caches only the offline shell); and a
Node or npm upgrade between the recorded build and the skip can change the
emitted bundle with an unchanged ``website/`` tree. Neither can serve stale
application code. The third is that :func:`build_record` fingerprints what is on
disk AFTER the run rather than at the build step, so anything that changes
``website/`` or ``static/dist`` between the build's completion and the derivation
is recorded as if the build had read it: a peer ``_stage_dist`` caller (the
dashboard's own update, pod provisioning) restaging once
``frontend.build_and_stage`` released the staging lock, or a ``website/`` edit
committed in the checkout inside that same window. What the build actually read is
not observable afterwards at any price, which is why this is a residual rather
than a bug to fix here, and the derivation is deliberately NOT the place that pays
for it: the verdict is, by reading :func:`website_source_identity` twice.

WHAT BOUNDS THAT THIRD RESIDUAL IS THE WINDOW, NOT A LATER CORRECTION, and it is
worth stating in those terms because the failure is silent. The window is small:
build+stage is the sync's LAST step, so it spans the child's exit path and one
executor hop rather than the rest of the run. But a pair formed inside it vouches
for a bundle built from a DIFFERENT ``website/`` source than the tree it names --
an older one, in the committed-edit case -- and it does not self-correct. A later
backend-only sync finds that tree and that digest both still on disk, skips, and
re-derives the identical pair, so it stands until a change moves the ``website/``
tree OID or the backend restarts. An unconditional build's own staleness in the
same window lasts one sync, so this is the one place where the skip's failure mode
outlives the build's rather than matching it.

The fourth is the one worth stating precisely, because it is where this design
stops and the reason it may. **Both git-derived halves of the verdict are
forgeable by an actor with write access to ``.git`` at our uid**, and no set of
config overrides closes that: an ``assume-unchanged`` bit in ``.git/index``
makes ``status`` report clean over arbitrary working-tree content, a line in
``.git/info/exclude`` hides a file from ``--untracked-files=all``, and a
``filter.<d>.clean`` driver runs while ``status`` hashes a stat-dirty file --
none of them a config key that :data:`_GIT_HARDENING` could name. So a checkout
that has been tampered with can be made to answer "the recorded tree, and
clean", and the build is skipped.

THAT BUYS THE ACTOR NOTHING, and that is what makes it a residual rather than
the hole it looks like. The reasoning is a capability comparison, not a hope:

* The skip cannot serve the actor's OWN bundle. ``staged_dist_digest`` is a live
  filesystem read compared against the recorded digest, so ``static/dist`` must
  be byte-identical to what the recorded build staged; substituting a bundle is a
  sha256 preimage, and staging one merely withholds the skip. The most a forged
  verdict achieves is that the last recorded build's own bundle stays served.
* The same actor already has strictly more WITHOUT the skip. Reaching ``.git``
  means code execution at our uid inside the sync -- an ``npm ci`` lifecycle
  script, or ``pip install -e .``'s build backend -- and the build step it would
  be suppressing is ``npm run build``, whose ``build`` script lives in the
  same-uid-writable ``website/package.json``, followed by a stage that copies
  the same-uid-writable ``website/dist``. So on the unconditional path that actor
  rewrites the build script to exit zero and hands its own bundle straight to
  ``static/dist``, under a sync that reports success. Unconditional building is
  not a defence against it; it is a wider version of the same exposure.

So the skip adds no capability, and the two are not comparable in the other
direction either. What separates this from the on-disk record this module
refuses (see above) is REACH: forging a live git read steers only the run the
actor is already inside, where it owns the build anyway, while a durable record
on disk would let it steer a LATER sync it is not part of. Reach beyond the
compromised run is the property worth engineering against, and the record's
absence from disk is what removes it.

This module imports ONLY the standard library. The sync runner is a stdlib-only
``python -c`` program that must not import ``kiro_crew`` (that would drag in the
package ``__init__`` chain, which imports croniter and the rest of the runtime),
so this helper is snapshotted at import and executed BY PATH the same way
``dep_sync`` and ``npm_preflight`` are -- see ``server._sync_start_locked``.

    Two questions, one walk:

      * PRESENCE -- the build+stage step's job is to populate ``static/dist``,
        and running it is what repairs an absent one. ``None`` here (no
        directory, no ``index.html``, anything in the tree that cannot be read)
        means there is nothing trustworthy to serve, so the build must run.
      * IDENTITY -- the digest covers each entry's path, KIND and bytes, so it
        changes on any restage, any missing or truncated chunk, and any added
        file. Recording it and re-checking it at skip time is what makes an
        out-of-band restage, or a bundle damaged since the recorded build,
        withhold the skip instead of being silently inherited by it.

    The serialization is INJECTIVE, not merely separated: no two distinct trees
    can produce one digest, because every variable-length field carries its own
    fixed-width length and every entry its kind -- see :func:`_frame` for the
    collision a separator admits and what it would cost here. What is framed is
    what a static file server serves: each entry's path within the bundle,
    whether it is a file, a directory or a symlink, and every byte of every
    file, plus the entry count. Metadata that cannot change a served byte (mode,
    mtime, owner) is deliberately out, so a permission bit does not force a
    rebuild; directories are in even though they serve nothing themselves, which
    is what makes an added, removed or newly-symlinked directory visible.

    Hashing the whole tree rather than ``index.html`` alone is what covers the
    divergences the marker file cannot see, and they are reachable rather than
    theoretical. Vite's ``emptyOutDir`` deletes the previous bundle in directory
    order before writing the new one, so a build+stage step killed mid-empty (the
    run watchdog's timeout kill, or gateway shutdown reaping the tree) can leave
    ``index.html`` still byte-identical to the recorded one while the chunks it
    references are already gone. That step exits non-zero, so it never records a
    new stamp -- the OLD stamp stands, and on a backend-only retry the tree OID
    and the cleanliness gate both still pass. An index-only digest would skip
    there and serve a shell whose every asset 404s. The same walk covers the
    public assets vite copies verbatim under stable unhashed names
    (``/vendor/*.mjs``, icons, ``sw.js``), which no digest of ``index.html``
    describes.

    ``os.walk`` follows the top path, so this covers both the packaged real
    directory and the source-tree symlink to ``website/dist``, and it is ordered
    (directories and files sorted) so the digest is a function of the tree rather
    than of readdir order. It does NOT follow links below that path, so a
    symlinked subdirectory is framed as one link entry and never descended into;
    a dangling link is not a directory, so it lands among the files and fails to
    open. ``onerror`` re-raises rather than letting the walk silently skip an
    unreadable subtree, which would fingerprint a partial tree and could match.

    The digest is a value of this function alone, held only in memory (see the
    module docstring), and both ends of every comparison come from one capture of
    this file: the backend derives the record with the module it imported, and the
    runner checks it against a snapshot of those same bytes. So changing what this
    frames needs no version tag to be safe -- there is no stored digest anywhere,
    and no way for two framings to meet. It simply makes each record the backend
    holds stop matching, which costs that checkout one frontend build.

    therefore indistinguishable from a good build by any artifact comparison --
    never reaches this, so the backend keeps holding the older pair (or none) and
    the next sync rebuilds.

    ``None`` -- meaning "no record, so the next sync builds" -- whenever the pair
    cannot honestly be formed: a dirty ``website/`` (the build read a working tree
    no commit describes, so no tree OID identifies what it produced), an
    unresolvable tree OID, or a bundle that cannot be read. The caller REPLACES
    whatever it held with this answer, so a build this function declines to vouch

    """The one decision the runner consults: skip the frontend build+stage step?

    ``recorded_tree`` and ``recorded_dist`` are a :func:`build_record` pair, passed
    as VALUES. There is no parameter that could name a file, and that is the
    invariant this signature exists to enforce rather than merely document: every
    other input to the verdict is recomputed live from git and the filesystem
    here, so the pair is the only historical CLAIM involved -- and a claim on disk
    is a claim any same-uid sync step can rewrite. See the module docstring.

    ``True`` only when all three hold, which together say "the bundle on disk was
    produced by a completed build from exactly the source this sync is landing":

      * :func:`website_source_identity` -- the source a build would read now --
        is the tree OID the record names, AND
      * every file of the bundle currently staged is still the one that build
        staged, AND
      * the source identity is STILL that tree OID afterwards.

    The identity is read twice, either side of the bundle walk, because the
    checkout is mutable while this runs and the walk is the long half. One reading
    would date the verdict from before a hash of every served byte, so a
    ``website/`` commit landing during it would be skipped over and never built.
    Two make the verdict's window the pair of reads rather than the walk -- the
    same window an unconditional build has between reading the tree and reading a
    file, which is the floor here and not something a check can go below. Why the
    two questions inside that one read are ordered the way they are -- and why
    ordering them the other way admits exactly the interleaving above with no walk
    needed -- is in :func:`website_source_identity`.

    The revision asked about is ``HEAD`` -- the same one :func:`build_record`
    describes, and never the ref the sync is merging. The runner reaches this only
    after the merge step, so HEAD IS the source the build would read, while the
    ref equals it only when the merge actually fast-forwarded. ``git merge
    --ff-only <ref>`` ALSO exits zero, reporting "Already up to date", whenever
    the ref is an ancestor of HEAD -- which is what a checkout carrying local
    commits looks like. Asking about the ref there answers about a source no build
    will read, and answers ``True`` for a committed ``website/`` change that then
    never gets built. Asking about HEAD cannot fail that way: after a successful
    ``merge --ff-only`` HEAD is either the ref (the same answer) or ahead of it
    (correctly refused).

    Everything else -- a ``website/`` change (a different tree OID), an empty
    record, a failed or interrupted earlier build (which produced none), an
    out-of-band restage, a staged tree damaged since the record, a dirty or
    untracked-carrying ``website/``, an absent ``static/dist``, or git being
    unavailable to answer any of it -- returns ``False``, and the sync builds as
    it does without this module.

    ``npm ci`` is not part of this verdict: it is unconditional. See the module
    docstring for why its skip has no safe formulation.
