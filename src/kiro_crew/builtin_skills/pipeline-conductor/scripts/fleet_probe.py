"""Batch fleet probe — the deterministic half of the pipeline conductor's patrol.

One invocation answers, for every watched worker session, "does anything need
judgment this cycle?" — plus host posture — so a quiet patrol cycle costs one
script call and a couple of output lines instead of N transcript reads.

Usage:
    python3 fleet_probe.py --config <probe-config.json>
    python3 fleet_probe.py --config <probe-config.json> --mark-handled KEY TAG DIGEST

Config (JSON):
    {
      "sessions": ["dashboard_chat-601-1788099254", ...],   # slot keys to watch
      "idle_alert_secs": 900,      # silent longer than this -> IDLE alert
      "tail_bytes": 200000,        # per-session transcript PARSE cap
      "load_alert_per_cpu": 1.5,   # 1-min loadavg / cpu above this -> hot
      "err_res": [...],            # extra error-tail regexes (optional)
      "banned_process_res": [...], # cmdline regexes for banned ops (optional)
      "init_timeout_res": [...],   # initialize-timeout tails (optional)
      "watchdog_res": [...],       # turn-ended-by-stall-watchdog tails (optional)
      "fleet_worktrees": [...]     # absolute roots this fleet owns (optional)
    }

Every regex key is validated at load time: a bad pattern is malformed config
(exit 2 with the offending pattern), never a crash mid-cycle. ``tail_bytes``
caps how much of a transcript is PARSED, not how much is read -- the whole file
is read either way, which is what makes the tail index monotonic for free.

Paths are DERIVED, never configurable -- the same containment rule for every
location this script touches, because its config is authored by a no-write
agent and a config-chosen path would quietly widen what an approved run can
reach:

  * transcripts are read from ``<data home>/sessions`` only, where the data
    home is ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` (else ``~/.kiro/crew``) -- the gateway this
    conductor belongs to, not an arbitrary directory;
  * the handled-set state file is ALWAYS ``<config path>.state.json``;
  * the banned-process scan reads ``/proc`` (``$KIROCREW_PROBE_PROC_ROOT``
    exists for the test harness).

A session key that does not match a transcript stem directly is also tried as
``dashboard_<key>`` (and with ``:`` as ``_``): ``session_create`` answers slot
keys while the store prefixes the surface, and a raw key must not read as a
missing session -- GONE triggers reclaim, and a false GONE is how an active
item gets duplicate-dispatched.

The data home is ``$KIROCREW_HOME`` when set, else ``~/.kiro/crew`` — the same
resolution every pipeline script uses.

Output (text, one line per FIRING signal; suppressed sessions print nothing):
    🔔 <session-key> <age>s <TAG> i=<index> d=<digest>

``i=`` is the index of the last LINE in that session's transcript -- a monotonic
per-session position. An unchanged index across two probes is *no progress*,
whether or not a turn is open, and that is the discriminator a self-deadlocked
worker cannot fake. It is a position, so it carries no transcript content.

Metadata only, by design: transcript-derived text never appears in the output,
so no private session content crosses into the caller's context whatever keys
the config watches. Content, when a ruling needs it, is read through the
workspace-authorized session tools.
    BANNED pid=<pid> rule=<regex> cwd=fleet|unknown
    OK <n> watched, <m> fired | load/cpu <x> (<posture>) | mem <G>G
       | banned <k> | foreign <k> | deliver init-timeout <a>, watchdog <b>

``banned`` counts fleet-owned matches only -- a banned command shape running in
an unrelated checkout on the same host is somebody else's business, and counting
it made the conductor stop a worker that was not the offender. Those are
summarised as ``foreign`` and not printed. ``deliver`` is the honest admission
instrument: load and memory can both read healthy while the fleet cannot
deliver, so sessions whose tail carries an initialize timeout or a
stall-watchdog turn end are counted every cycle, fired or not.

Tags: the worker protocol words (``WORKING/PR/GREEN/BLOCKED/STANDDOWN/
PROPOSAL``) -- recognised in their protocol form, ``<WORD>:``, so prose that
merely opens with one is not a report -- plus ``ERR`` for an error/throttle
tail, ``IDLE`` for silence past the threshold, ``TERMINAL`` for a session whose
last dispositioned report ENDED its assignment (``STANDDOWN``/``PROPOSAL``) and
which has since written unprefixed text, and ``-`` when a tail carries no tag
(never fires on its own). Tool rows never classify: a protocol word or an error
phrase inside a tool card is quoted text, not a report.

The tag is the newest REPORT, not the newest message, because ``BLOCKED`` is
STICKY: a probe samples rather than subscribes, and the protocol requires a
blocked worker to keep reporting status, so its own next message would displace
the only thing a newest-message classifier reads. A heartbeat (``WORKING``) and
unprefixed text leave a sticky report standing; any other report supersedes it.
``TERMINAL`` and sticky ``BLOCKED`` are kept distinct on purpose -- one says
close me, the other says a ruling is owed.

THE HANDLED SET replaces the overnight run's hand-grown ``grep -vE`` exclusion
pipe. Every fired line carries a ``d=<digest>`` field; ``--mark-handled KEY TAG
DIGEST`` records exactly that digest into the state file (compare-and-set: if
the tail moved on since the probe, the mark is REFUSED with exit 3 so the
caller re-probes instead of suppressing a payload nobody read). A signal is
then suppressed while (tag, digest) both still match. A new payload under the
same tag re-fires (a second GREEN with a new PR number is a new signal).
``IDLE`` marks expire after another ``idle_alert_secs``
so a nudged-but-still-silent worker re-alerts instead of vanishing.

A handled entry also records the tail ``index`` at the moment of the mark, and
the last dispositioned PROTOCOL tag under ``proto`` -- kept in its own field so a
later ``IDLE`` or ``GONE`` disposition cannot erase the fact that the worker
already filed a terminal report. Neither field takes part in the digest, so a
state file written before they existed still suppresses exactly as it did.

Deliberately boring properties, do not weaken:
  * No subprocess, ever. Reads transcripts, ``/proc`` and ``loadavg`` directly.
  * The only write is the probe's own state file, atomically, and only on
    ``--mark-handled``.
  * A per-session problem (unreadable file, malformed line) degrades that one
    row, never the cycle. Exit 0 when the probe ran; 2 on malformed config.

#: wrong: ``setup.cfg`` documents that ``auto`` is bounded by the rootdir
#: conftest's ``pytest_xdist_auto_num_workers`` hook, which sizes the pool by
#: available memory and by what concurrent runs on the host already hold, and
#: that "an explicit ``-n <N>`` bypasses the budget". So on THIS repo the
