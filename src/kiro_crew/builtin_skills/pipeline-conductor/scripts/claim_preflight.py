"""Claim preflight — the deterministic claim predicate for the pipeline conductor.

One invocation answers every cheap question about one candidate work item and
returns ONE verdict, so a worker dispatch is never spent discovering that the
work does not exist.

WHY FIVE QUESTIONS AND NOT ONE. The predicate this replaces was a single prose
line, ``gh pr list --search``, and it was blind in three directions at once.
Each blind spot cost a whole dispatch to discover:

  * an item already fixed by a MERGED PR was claimed and dispatched days later
    — an ``--state open`` query structurally cannot see a merged PR — with the
    reporter's own "happy to have it closed" sitting on the thread;
  * four dispatches went to items that each had an OPEN PR carrying
    ``Fixes #N``, because the predicate read one field
    (``closedByPullRequestsReferences``) that came back empty for all of them.
    It still does: measured on this repo, two items closed by merged PRs both
    answer ``[]``. That is why this script never asks that question at all — it
    reads the item's TIMELINE, which sees both the fork PRs and the merged ones;
  * three items said "I am claiming this issue" / "Ownership claimed by @X" in
    PROSE, in the body, which no label or field query sees.

The lesson those three share, and the design rule of this script: **one
question with an empty answer is not permission.** So it asks all five, and an
unanswerable question yields UNKNOWN — never CLAIM.

Usage:
    python3 claim_preflight.py --repo <owner/repo> --item <N>
                              [--default-branch main]
                              [--repo-dir <path to a clone of the base>]
                              [--json]

    --repo            ``owner/name`` of the forge repository holding the item
    --item            the issue number
    --default-branch  the git rev a worker would branch from, as it is spelled
                      in ``--repo-dir`` (``main``, ``origin/main``, …)
    --repo-dir        a clone of the base. Needed only for the two questions
                      git can answer: whether a merged PR actually LANDED on
                      that branch, and whether a symbol the item names exists
                      there. Omitting it is not an error — but if the item has
                      a merged PR or names a symbol, the answer becomes
                      UNKNOWN rather than a guess. The clone is read as-is and
                      never fetched: keeping it current is the caller's job,
                      and a merge commit missing from a stale clone reports
                      UNKNOWN, never "did not land".
    --json            print exactly one JSON object instead of the human line

Exit codes (the conductor branches on these):

    0   CLAIM    — dispatch it
   10   SKIP     — covered or not workable; do not dispatch
   11   CLOSE    — triage debt: already fixed, or the reporter asked to close
    2            — malformed arguments or config
    3   UNKNOWN  — a check could not be answered (forge unreachable, rate
                   limited, no clone for a question only git can answer)

The five checks, all of them, every call:

  1. ``open_prs``      open PRs referencing the item, FORK PRs included, with
                       ``is_cross_repository`` and author per hit.
  2. ``merged_prs``    MERGED PRs referencing the item, each annotated
                       ``landed`` by ``git merge-base --is-ancestor``. A PR
                       merged into somewhere other than the branch a worker
                       would start from is not coverage.
  3. ``prose_claim``   the body and the NEWEST human comment, scanned for
                       self-claim phrases and for closure requests — over what
                       the author SAYS, with code fences, backtick spans,
                       blockquotes and quoted spans removed first, because a
                       phrase inside them is being cited. A closure request
                       also needs standing (the reporter, or a repository
                       insider); CLOSE acts on live work, so a passer-by asking
                       is not enough.
  4. ``symbol_on_base``every symbol the item names, by ``git grep`` on the
                       default branch. Absent means the target code may live
                       only on an unmerged branch — but that reading holds only
                       for a BUG-class item, so absence vetoes only when the
                       item's own metadata corroborates that class. Otherwise it
                       downgrades to ``CLAIM risk=high``: a feature request
                       names the symbol it PROPOSES to add, and parking it would
                       be a permanent false veto on a whole item class.
  5. ``recency``       age and ``authorAssociation``. A freshly opened item
                       from an active contributor is a high self-claim risk —
                       surfaced as ``risk=high``, never a veto on its own. The
                       consumer is the skill: ``risk=high`` means the item is
                       not batched, it gets a live re-check immediately before
                       the atomic claim.

Verdict precedence, first match wins (see :func:`verdict`, a pure function of
the checks dict so every branch is unit-testable with no forge access):

  1. a ``merged_prs`` entry with ``landed``  → CLOSE ``already-fixed``
  2. any ``open_prs`` entry                  → SKIP  ``open-pr``
  3. ``prose_claim.closure_requested``       → CLOSE ``reporter-asked-close``
  4. ``prose_claim.claimed_by_other``        → SKIP  ``prose-claim``
  5. ``symbol_on_base.missing`` AND bug-class→ SKIP  ``symbol-absent``
  6. any check errored                       → UNKNOWN
  7. otherwise                               → CLAIM, annotated with ``risk``,
                                               which an UNCORROBORATED absent
                                               symbol forces to ``high``

Note that 6 sits BELOW the positive findings on purpose: a definite answer to
one question outranks a partial view of another, and no error path can reach
CLAIM.

Deliberately boring properties, do not weaken:

  * Forge access goes through ``gh``; no hand-rolled HTTP and no token is ever
    read by this script. ``run_gh`` refuses a mutating argv outright, so the
    no-write property is enforced rather than merely intended: this script
    never labels, assigns, comments, or closes.
  * At most one forge call per question. The timeline is fetched once and
    answers checks 1 and 2 together; each referencing PR is then detailed once,
    because fork-ness and the merge commit exist only on the pull object.
  * Nothing user-authored reaches stdout. Failures are reported as SLUGS, not
    as forge stderr, and a prose match reports the PATTERN that fired, never
    the matched text — this output lands in an agent's context.
  * A closed-unmerged PR is neither coverage nor a claim. It is abandoned work
    and it frees the item, so it appears in neither list.
