"""Pipeline-conductor agent installer + bundled probe/budget scripts.

The installer tests mirror ``test_conductor_agent.py``'s shape: stub the agents
dir and ``build_agent_config``, run the installer, assert on the JSON it wrote.
The script tests run the real files over fixtures — they are the deterministic
half of the conductor's patrol, so their vocabulary (protocol tags, handled-set
suppression, budget verdicts) is pinned here.
