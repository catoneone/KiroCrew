"""Direct unit tests for the backend-only frontend-skip decision.

``frontend_skip`` is the pure, stdlib-only helper the sync runner consults at
runtime to decide whether a backend-only Pull+Build may skip the frontend BUILD
(``npm ci`` is deliberately not a candidate), plus the record that makes such a
skip safe. These tests pin the decision: it fires only when a record derived
after a COMPLETED earlier build names the very ``website/`` tree this sync is
landing, that build's bundle is still staged, and ``website/`` is clean on disk
-- and it is conservative everywhere else.

The record is passed to :func:`may_skip_frontend` as two VALUES, and this module
has no function that reads one off disk. That is the invariant the signatures
enforce: a record stored anywhere a sync step can write is a record a sync step
can forge, and the steps that run before the gated build execute code from the
revision being landed at the same uid as the process that reads it. So the
record lives in the Dev Fleet backend's memory and reaches the runner inside its
own script text -- see ``runtime._FRONTEND_BUILD_RECORD``.

They run against a REAL git repository rather than a stubbed ``subprocess.run``.
Every falsifier this module exists to close is a statement about git's actual
behaviour -- that ``merge --ff-only`` succeeds over a dirty ``website/``, that
two revisions with identical ``website/`` trees share a tree OID, that
``--untracked-files=all`` is what makes a new file visible -- and a fake that
replays canned output cannot fail when one of those is misunderstood. Only the
"git is unavailable" paths use a stub, because that condition cannot be
provoked from a working repository.

The module is loaded BY FILE PATH, exactly as the sync runner loads its
snapshot, rather than through ``kiro_crew.apps.builtins.dev_fleet`` -- the
dotted import would execute the package ``__init__`` chain (which pulls in
croniter and the rest of the runtime), and the module imports nothing but the
standard library, so it needs no package context. Loading by path is also what
makes these runnable without the project's runtime dependencies installed.
